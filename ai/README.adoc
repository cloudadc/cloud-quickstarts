== Generative AI(生成式人工智能)

=== Definition

* Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data.

=== How Generative AI Works

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content.

* The process of *learning from existing content* is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model.
* When given a prompt, Generative AI uses this *statistical model* to predict what an expected response might be and generates new content.

=== Generative AI Model Types

[cols="2,5a"]
.*Generative language models*
|===
|Item |Generative `language` models 

|Definition
|Generative language models learn about patterns in language through training data.

Then, give some text, they predict *what comes next*.

Generative language models are pattern-matching systems.

|Input
|Text

|Output
|

* *Text* - Translation, Summarization, Question Answering, Grammar Correction
* *Image* - Image Generation, Video Generation
* *Audio* - Text to Speech
* *Decisions* - Play Games

.*Generative image models*
|===
|Item |Generative `image` models

|Definition
|Generative image models produce new images using techniques like diffusion.

Then give a prompt or related imagery, they *transform random noise into image or generate images from prompts*.

|Input
|Image

|Output
|

* *Text* - Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering, Image Search 
* *Image* - Super Resolution, Image Completion
* *Video* - Animation
